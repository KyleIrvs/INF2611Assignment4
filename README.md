# INF2611Assignment4

This was my final assignment for my visual programming module (INF 2611) at UNISA. 

It is a simple and incompleted project with a working user interface. It was made to show how python can work with PyQt, as well as how python can work with a database to show, store, fetch and update data in that database. It follows a case study about the olympic games and how to use the interface we made to manipulate the database. It allows for adding, updating and deletion of various events and venues from the database. This assignment was done over a few days as it did start off as my first assignment and was built upon with each assignment. Some features were not coded in as they were not required at the time and I have not worked on it since then. All .py files as well as the UI files made in PyQt are provided.

It shows my understanding of UI development, database connections with Python and MySQLdb, PyQt, MySQL, SQL, as well as python 3.4. It will not work once downloaded as the database used in the assignment was running on my localhost.
